Visualizing Earthquake Data with JS & APIs

##  Mapping Data

Creating interactive maps that are easy to use is a necessary skill for someone in the data visualization field. From the New York Times to projects for the Center for Strategic International Studies, maps allow us to explore, understand, and make decisions about our world.

In this project I want to showcase to you how to create an interactive World Map using JavaScript and D3. Library. 

For this purpose I used Geojson, a type of JSON file specifically designed to host geographical information. Geojson data can be found in many apps that have a mapping feature, such as ridesharing, navigation and food, and package delivery services. Even the apps on your smart phone that allow you to track your location can store and use. Geojson data, the Geojson format is the industry standard for representing simple geographical features and non spatial attributes. We will export geographical features such as points which contain addresses and locations like latitude and longitude coordinates, line strings which contain coordinates for the boundaries of streets, highways (you can explore this data in the  repository branches). Travel routes and tectonic plates and polygons which contain coordinates for the boundaries of ZIP codes, counties, countries, provinces, and tracts of land. We'll also explore non spatial attributes, which is data that is independent of all geometric considerations and packaged in the hierarchical structure of Geojson. Examples include elevation, temperature, rain accumulation, hail size, tornado or hurricane strength, and the magnitude of an earthquake.

For this Data Visualisation Analysis I used JavaScript and the D3 library, to retrieve Geojson Earthquake Data and Tectonic Plate data in order to populate a Geographical Map. For this purpose I also used the Leaflet Library, then the Mapbox API.

The Map will showcase the GeoData that will include the Earthquake Data in relation to the Tectonic Plates location on the Earth. Geojson Earthquake Data was obtained from [The United States Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/) a scientific agency of the United States government.

Interactive World Map will alow you to explore Earthquakes location with Earthquake magnitude in Past 7 Days.

Let see the final results.
